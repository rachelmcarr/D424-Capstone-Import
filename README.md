# Rare Oddities Tattoo and Piercings Web Application

**Rare Oddities Tattoo and Piercings Web Application** is a full-stack web application built for tattoo and piercing shops to manage customer intake, consent forms, service records, and artist portfolios. This capstone project was developed as part of my Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering at WGU, and demonstrates my ability to deliver a complete, scalable, and professional-grade solution from backend to frontend.

## Project Overview

Rare Oddities is designed to streamline operations for body art studios, with features for:

- **Client Intake Wizard**  
  Guided, conditional multi-step intake for customers, dynamically adapting to tattoo, piercing, and parental consent needs.

- **Consent Form Management**  
  Digital collection and storage of tattoo, piercing, and parental consent forms, each tied to specific services.

- **Service Tracking**  
  Artists and staff can create and view completed services, upload images, and link them to client history and portfolios.

- **Artist Portfolios**  
  Public-facing artist pages showcase bios and galleries of completed work.

- **Admin Staff Portal**  
  Secure login for staff to manage customers, artists, services, and intake records.

## Key Features

- Dynamic Intake Wizard with conditional logic
- Unique consent forms per service and for minors
- Real-time updates and record linking
- Public and admin views with role separation
- Artist-managed image galleries and bios
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**  
- Angular (TypeScript)  
- HTML5 + CSS3 (Custom & Bootstrap-inspired)  

**Backend:**  
- Java Spring Boot  
- RESTful APIs  
- JPA/Hibernate  
- MySQL  

**Deployment:**  
- Hosted with Render (Spring Boot) and Vercel (Angular)

## Object-Oriented Design

This application demonstrates core OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation** with DTOs and service layers
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** via shared consent form structure
- **Validation** at both form and entity levels
- **Separation of Concerns** in layered architecture

## Scalability & Real-World Use

The Rare Oddities app is production-ready and designed for real businesses. It supports:

- Easily adding new service types or form templates
- Robust validation and error handling
- Admin audit trails via user attribution
- Extendable role-based permissions

I was the sole developer for the project, responsible for:

- System design and database modeling  
- Backend development (Spring Boot REST API)  
- Frontend development (Angular components and services)  
- UI/UX design and responsive layout  
- Deployment and documentation
